		<h2>How to put command codes in Minecraft Java Edition:</h2>
		<h4>Minecraft Java Edition is a great game, with the option to either play on 'Creative', on which you have infinite amounts of anything, or 'Survival', on which you have to collect or craft everything you want. However, you can actually type command codes in the chat (if the world options allow) to have any item in the game, kill other people on the server or even change from 'Creative' to 'Survival'. The way this works is actually pretty simple: you press 'T' to enter chat, you type in '/' (it's a forward slash), you type in any command you want to use and just press enter. And that's pretty much it!</h4>
